    Northcoders is expanding to France 🎉🥖. 
    Unfortunately, our team on the ground in Paris doesn't speak the best English and has been providing us with student data partly in French. 
    This function will take an object representing a student's data, a key that needs changing, and its English translation.  
    E.g. 
    const student = {

    const keyToChange = 'prénom'

    {
      firstName: 'Carla',
      surname: 'Bruni,
      job: 'Artist'
